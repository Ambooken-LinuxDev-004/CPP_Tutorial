#include <iostream> - header file, which helps in performing input & output operations.

using namespace std; - makes code simpler(includes all identifiers into global space). std is also an library which contains obects etc...(e.g cout)

cout - to print output(like texts etc...)
<< - insertion operator
endl - end line( u can use "\n" tol go to next line).

character is stored in '' while string is stored in "".

NOTE:- For Comparison Operators(<,>,==), the ouput is always 1(true) or 0(false).

Logical Operators(&&(and), ||(or), !(not)). Returns 1(true) or 0(false).

>> - extraction operator
cin >> variable_name; - To add input value into a declared variable.

#### COMPILE AND RUN A SIMPLE C++ FILE:- ####

** g++ <filename>.cpp -o <outputfilename> - To compile the file.
** ./<outputfilename> - Then to run the file.

** g++ -I /usr/include/eigen3 <filename>.cpp -o <outputfilename> - 'I' flag says to g++ compiler where to look for additional includes(header files).
